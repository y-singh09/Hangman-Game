## Overview
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the objective is to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. This implementation of Hangman is a simple web-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Interactive web interface
- Random word selection from a predefined list
- Tracking of incorrect guesses
- Display of current word state (with guessed letters revealed and unknown letters as underscores)
- Win/Lose detection and notification

## How to Play
1. The game will display a word with underscores representing each letter of the word.
